  summary: Measured in texture pixels based on our standard pixel density for 32x32 textures.  So a value of 32 would be one block high; the typical value of 48 is the full height of tallgrass or a flowerTall because those use 48x48 pixel textures

  syntax:
    content: int drawnHeight { get; set; }
    parameters: []

      type: System.Int32
